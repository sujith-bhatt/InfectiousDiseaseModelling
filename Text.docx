I have a usecase in my company where we are using a third party vendor for transcription of customer center calls. The transcription service being provided offers Phonetic Boosting services (give a list of phrases or words to improve model performance). My job is to plan out, from a process perspective, how to identify the right words/phrases to be boosted, what is the frequency at which this process of identifying of words/phrases needs to be done, a reusable pipeline to go through with the process, how to evaluate the difference pre and post boost. give me a detailed plan

To implement and continuously improve a phonetic boosting process for your call center transcription use case, here is a step-by-step plan covering identification, pipeline setup, iteration frequency, and impact evaluation.

### Identifying Words and Phrases for Phonetic Boosting

- Start by analyzing recent transcripts for recurring transcription errors, especially on domain-specific, brand, or regional words (product names, customer names, localities, technical jargon) [1][2].
- Review customer complaints or QA flagged cases that mention incorrect or missed keywords.
- Use word frequency analysis and error reports to pinpoint high-value terms with low transcription success rates [3].
- Consult with business stakeholders and customer support teams for a list of terms that are critical for compliance or analytics.

### Frequency of Re-Identification

- Review and update the boosted list quarterly, or in sync with:
   - Product launches or feature releases.
   - Major business/process changes (new campaigns, regulatory updates).
   - Surge in transcription errors for particular words/phrases detected through ongoing monitoring [4].
- Set up alerting in analytics to detect spikes in OOV (out-of-vocabulary) or low-confidence transcriptions for early intervention.

### Pipeline for Phonetic Boosting

#### 1. Data Collection
- Gather call audio and corresponding initial transcripts for a defined rolling window (e.g., last 1–3 months).

#### 2. Error & Keyword Analysis
- Use automated scripts to extract word error rates, identify most frequent substitutions, deletions, and insertions [5].
- Flag business-defined critical vocabulary and names that appear incorrectly or as low-confidence in transcripts.

#### 3. Boost List Curation
- Rank candidate words/phrases by frequency, business importance, and current error rate.
- Curate and validate the list with stakeholders to ensure it aligns with business and compliance needs [1].

#### 4. Boost Application
- Integrate approved phrases into the phonetic boosting feature via the vendor’s API or configuration interface; assign appropriate boost weights/levels [5][6].

#### 5. Monitoring and Analytics
- Set up dashboards to track boost performance, measuring error rates for boosted words, false positives, and new issues.

#### 6. Documentation & Feedback Loop
- Document every boost cycle with rationale, affected phrases, and before/after performance summaries.
- Schedule regular feedback sessions with business users and technical teams.

### Evaluation: Pre vs Post Boost Impact

- Before applying phonetic boosting, collect baseline metrics:
   - Word Error Rate (WER), Sentence Error Rate (SER), term-specific accuracy for target words.
   - Confidence scores per transcription instance.
- After boosting, collect the same metrics for a comparable set of calls [2][7].
- Statistically test for significant improvement: a reduction in WER/SER, increase in correct hits for the boosted words, and reduced OOV instances.
- Combine automated metrics with human QA spot checks on random samples for critical phrases.
- Document and share results with internal stakeholders, including summary tables highlighting pre/post impact.

### Summary Table: Example Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                | Pre-Boost | Post-Boost | Target |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| WER on boosted terms  | 18% [7]   | 10%        | ≤10%   |
| Boosted term accuracy | 80%    | 94%       | ≥95%   |
| False positive rate   | 5%     | 6%        | ≤7%    |

By systematizing the discovery, application, and evaluation of phonetic boosting, the process remains efficient and business-aligned, while providing stakeholders with actionable QA insights on the effectiveness of each boost cycle [1][2][7].
